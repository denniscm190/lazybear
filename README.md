# lazybear

Lazybear is my first iOS app and programming project. It is was a stock tracker app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch written in Swift and SwiftUI. With Lazybear, you can save your favourite stocks, check their current and historic stock price and the main financial ratios.

I’ve built the backend in Python using Flask and store the data in a MySQL database. It is was hosted on AWS.

It was a nice project and I learnt a lot.

After two rejections from Apple, I managed to finally publish the app to the App Store * (it’s no longer published). It was awesome to see my first app in the App Store.
